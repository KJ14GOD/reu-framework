**üéØ MISSION: Evaluate the correctness of vulnerability analysis and identify learning opportunities**

**FUNCTION ANALYSIS:**
Function: {function_name}
Project: {project_info.get('project', 'Unknown') if project_info else 'Unknown'}

**FUNCTION CODE:**
```c
{function_body}
```

**FINAL DECISION:**
{final_decision}

**DEBATE HISTORY:**
{debate_summary}

{ground_truth_context}
{cve_context}

**YOUR EVALUATION TASK:**

**STEP 1: CORRECTNESS ASSESSMENT**
- Is the final decision correct given the code and context?
- If ground truth is provided, compare against it
- If no ground truth, assess based on code analysis

**STEP 2: REASONING QUALITY**
- Was the reasoning sound and evidence-based?
- Were the right tools and analysis methods used?
- Was the debate productive and focused?

**STEP 3: ERROR ANALYSIS (if incorrect)**
- What specific mistake was made?
- Was it a false positive or false negative?
- What evidence was missed or misinterpreted?
- How could this be prevented in future analyses?

**STEP 4: LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- What patterns should be learned from this case?
- What analysis techniques need improvement?
- What additional context would have helped?

**STEP 5: CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**
- How confident should we be in this evaluation?
- What factors affect the reliability of this assessment?

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**

**Correctness:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Decision matches ground truth or accurate code analysis
- ‚ùå INCORRECT: Decision contradicts ground truth or code analysis
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY_CORRECT: Decision direction correct but reasoning flawed

**Error Types:**
- False Positive: Called vulnerable when actually secure
- False Negative: Called secure when actually vulnerable
- Reasoning Error: Correct decision but wrong reasoning
- Evidence Error: Missed key evidence or misinterpreted code

**Learning Categories:**
- Pattern Recognition: Missed specific vulnerability patterns
- Tool Usage: Ineffective use of analysis tools
- Context Understanding: Failed to consider important context
- Reasoning Logic: Flawed logical reasoning
- Evidence Gathering: Incomplete evidence collection

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**

**EVALUATION SUMMARY:**
- Correctness: [CORRECT/INCORRECT/PARTIALLY_CORRECT]
- Error Type: [FALSE_POSITIVE/FALSE_NEGATIVE/REASONING_ERROR/EVIDENCE_ERROR/NONE]
- Confidence: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

**DETAILED ANALYSIS:**
- **Code Evidence:** [Specific code patterns that support or contradict the decision]
- **Reasoning Quality:** [Assessment of the logical reasoning used]
- **Tool Effectiveness:** [How well the analysis tools were used]
- **Context Understanding:** [Whether important context was considered]

**ERROR ANALYSIS (if incorrect):**
- **Root Cause:** [Specific reason for the error]
- **Missed Evidence:** [Key evidence that was overlooked]
- **Misinterpretation:** [How evidence was misunderstood]

**LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES:**
- **Pattern Learning:** [Specific patterns to recognize in future]
- **Tool Improvement:** [How to better use analysis tools]
- **Context Enhancement:** [Additional context that would help]
- **Reasoning Enhancement:** [How to improve logical reasoning]

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- **Immediate Actions:** [What should be done differently next time]
- **System Improvements:** [How to improve the overall analysis system]
- **Training Focus:** [What areas need more training/attention]

**Examples:**
- "CORRECT - Properly identified buffer overflow in strcpy usage"
- "INCORRECT - False positive: missed bounds checking in strncpy"
- "PARTIALLY_CORRECT - Right decision but missed the actual vulnerability pattern"
- "INCORRECT - False negative: failed to recognize integer overflow pattern"

**CRITICAL: Be thorough and constructive. Focus on actionable learning opportunities.**"""
